# Covid-Detection-From-Xray-Images
step 1. To run my code, please, change the path in the CORONAXRAY.m file 
to the directory containing all the sample images. 

step 2. Please, change the ind_for_test and image_index in the MATLAB file 
to 30 from 270. This will cover all the sample X-ray images. I left some 
comments in the code.

step 3. It may take a while to run the code with all different k values.
Please, set k as 5 (k=5) for k-fold and comment out the for loop with the end. 
I left a tiny comment on this. 

If anything does not work, please, email me at johnkm37@gmail.com
